# Java-Check-String-for-Number
This small program can be used to determine if a string contains numbers. This is useful for programs that want only number input from the user and Try Catch or for what ever reason other libraries cannot be used.

## How to use
1. Look at my StringtoNumber.java file... You should be good after that!
